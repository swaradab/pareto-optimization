# pareto-optimization
pareto_front.ipynb contains the code to find the pareto optimal front from a collection of feasible solutions. Pareto optimization is a method for multiobjective optimization. In order to do implement Pareto optimization, the recursive Kung's algorithm is implemented.
Pareto Optimization here is applied to the problem of finding the optimal placement of distributed generation units (DGs) in a standard distribution system (here it is the IEEE 33 bus radial distribution network). 
The 2 DGs are placed in every possible configuration in the network (the feasible solutions) and the Kung's algorithm is used to find the solution which minimizes the total Active Power Loss, Reactive Power Loss and Voltage Deviation in the distribution system. Results related to the power loss and voltage deviation throughout the distribution system for all possible DG configurations at different times throughout the day are obtained through simulations in Matlab. The code related to these simulations is not included here, only the results are included to provide inputs to the Pareto optimization algorithm.
Through Kung's algorithm, we find the optimal placements of the two DG units in the distribution system.
